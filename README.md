# Segway_Clone_2
Using Three Arduinos to made the Segway. Because It is fun . :)

I am using MPU6050 to be a main sensor.
2016/1/20 Testing clock source which is the most "precision" to get the value. (Using Excel to caluuate the Standard Deviation)
2016/1/20 Setting the DLPF to reduce the Arduino performance in caluuating.
NEXT -> Change the Sensor Sensity lower to avoid the Noise ( Maybe ~)
